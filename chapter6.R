#6.1#Problem 1:A: height
#problem 2: insulation, the way he is heating, e.g. solar, geothermal, etc.
#problem 3:The problem with that would be there one of the Octobers could have been warmer than the other due to the increase in global temperatures. A way of handing this would be only
#comparing the days of the month with similar temperatures over the course of 24 hours. 
#problem 4: The colder it is outside, the higher amount of gas used would be because you need more energy to create more heat. duh.
#problem 5: it would use a function to predict output of gas as function of temperatures.
#problem 6: Response Variable: it is what you're trying to understand, so I would guess that means the dependent variable (y/gas).; explan. var: the independent variable, or x/ temp outside.;
#Model Var: is the output of a function. y-var in the example.; residual: Shows how far each case value is from its model value. what gas was actually used compared to what the model predicts.

#6.2 Q1: I would guess yes. 
#Q2: it has a line for if each gender, and if each gener is married or single.
#q3:Sometimes certain functions might be of greater relevance, and some others might lose information. 
#q4: The furnace one, there are a finite amount of variables that come into play since it is a physics/chemistry question.

#6.3 Q1: Looking at gas output as function of outside temp.
#q2:Looking at JUST this model, yes that is what it indicates. But clearly there are times where this is not the case.

#6.4 Q1: Based on the major one chooses, figure out what one would expect to make as a newly graduated student.
#I would construct it by asking gathering data from various students of various majors, in an ideal case, it would be random students from across the nation. 
#I could go about it without making subjective choices, but yeah you could. Some potential ones might be on which majors to pick, and if i want to pick top of the class GPA students as a few examples.
#To reduce subjective choices, you could not choose to choose random students to survey and tons of other things.
#you could interpret them as the data shows. Doesn't mean it would be "correct" though.

#6.5 Q1:I think maybe it is a mean of all the values. 
#Q2: It is giving the graph a slope, linear.
#Q3: making a linear regression of each gender's data.

#6.6 Q1: left=response variable, right= what is done to it
#Q2: It appears there is an intercept term by default. 
#Q3:use a colon. year:sex

#6.7 Q1:
#makes a graph of year vs time and breaks things up by gender, and i think the other one is with an intercept included.
